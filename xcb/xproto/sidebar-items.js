This request returns the bounding box of the specified 16-bit character string in the specified `font` or the font contained in the specified graphics context.`font_ascent` is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all characters in the string. `font_descent` is set to the maximum of the descent metrics. `overall_width` is set to the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters in the string. For each character in the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters preceding it in the string. Let L be the left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all characters in the string. The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix indexing, each `xcb_char2b_t` structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most significant byte. If the font has no defined default character, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero metrics.Characters with all zero metrics are ignored.
